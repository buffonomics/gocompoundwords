# NodePrime Challenge


## Requirement:
Given a list of words like https://github.com/NodePrime/quiz/blob/master/word.list find the longest compound-word in the list, which is also a concatenation of other sub-words that exist in the list. The program should allow the user to input different data. The finished solution shouldn't take more than one hour. Any programming language can be used, but Go is preferred.


Fork this repo, add your solution and documentation on how to compile and run your solution. Please send us a link to your repo.

Obviously, we are looking for a fresh solution, not based on others' code.

## Requirements
* Go 1.4.x

No 3rd party libraries are used in this project.

## How to Run
Simply run the command ***go run main.go***.

You do not need to change your GOPATH to be able run this project.
This submission will feed itself off the data from the file ***word.list***.

### Testing Hints
To help you score the algorithmic integrity of this submission (and possibly others), here are some thinks to look out for.

* Should work well with unsorted input data.
* Should be case-insensitive, allowing for more flexible real-world processing.
